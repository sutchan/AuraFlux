# Changelog

All notable changes to the **Aura Flux** project will be documented in this file.

## [v1.7.41] - 2025-03-05

### Style
*   **🎨 Visuals:** Further tightened the brick spacing in "Kinetic Wall" mode for a near-seamless, high-density appearance.

## [v1.7.40] - 2025-03-05

### Style
*   **🎨 UI:** Enhanced the 3D text effect for a more pronounced, chiseled appearance.
*   **🎨 UI:** Reorganized the "Audio Reactive" and "3D Effect" toggles in the custom text panel into a side-by-side layout for improved clarity.

### Fix
*   **📄 License:** Replaced the incomplete `LICENSE` file with the full, standard Apache 2.0 license text.

## [v1.7.39] - 2025-03-05

### Style
*   **🎨 Visuals:** Fine-tuned the "Kinetic Wall" visualizer by reducing the spacing between bricks for a tighter, more cohesive and impactful wall effect.

## [v1.7.38] - 2025-03-05

### Refactor
*   **🎨 Visuals:** Reworked the "Kinetic Wall" visualizer for a smoother, more fluid aesthetic. Replaced the quantized, stepped motion with a continuous audio response and enabled bidirectional (push-pull) brick movement, eliminating perceived stuttering and creating a more organic, wave-like effect.

## [v1.7.37] - 2025-03-05

### Refactor
*   **🧠 AI:** Refined the AI identification service for improved accuracy, latency, and error handling. The system prompt now requests more descriptive mood analysis and canonical English keywords for robust styling. API request timeouts have been reduced, and specific error messages are now displayed for invalid API keys, significantly improving user feedback.

## [v1.7.36] - 2025-03-05

### Features
*   **🎨 Visuals:** Overhauled the "Deep Nebula" visualizer with a more colorful and dynamic engine. Gas clouds are now rendered with two-tone gradients based on the selected color theme, the background is a subtle radial gradient, and beat reactions are significantly more pronounced, creating a richer, more vibrant cosmic scene.
