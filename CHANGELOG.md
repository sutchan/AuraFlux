# Changelog

All notable changes to the **Aura Flux** project will be documented in this file.

## [v1.7.36] - 2025-03-05

### Features
*   **🎨 Visuals:** Overhauled the "Deep Nebula" visualizer with a more colorful and dynamic engine. Gas clouds are now rendered with two-tone gradients based on the selected color theme, the background is a subtle radial gradient, and beat reactions are significantly more pronounced, creating a richer, more vibrant cosmic scene.

## [v1.7.35] - 2025-03-05

### Features
*   **Feat:** Added a new "All Modes" option to the Smart Presets dropdown. Selecting it includes all visualizers in the auto-rotate playlist without changing the current visual style.
*   **Feat:** Implemented a "3D Effect" toggle for custom text in Advanced Mode, applying a subtle embossed look to the text overlay for added depth.
