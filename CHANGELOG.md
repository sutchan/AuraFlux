# Changelog

All notable changes to the **Aura Flux** project will be documented in this file.

## [v1.7.32] - 2025-03-04

### Internationalization & Robustness
*   **🌐 Full I18N Parity:** Completed all missing translation strings across 10 supported languages, ensuring a fully localized experience for all users.
*   **🛡️ Enhanced Robustness:** Implemented stricter validation for settings loaded from `localStorage` (`language`, `region`, `lyricsStyle`), preventing crashes from corrupted or outdated user data.

## [v1.7.25] - 2025-02-28

### Robustness & Internationalization
*   **🌍 100% I18N Completion:** All internationalization strings across 10 languages are now fully populated, including the newly integrated modes and more descriptive preset names.
*   **💡 Preset Naming:** Renamed "Smart Presets" in all languages to better reflect the visualizer they activate (e.g., "Hypnotic Calm" is now "Digital Waveform"), improving user clarity.
