### Removed
*   **🏔️ Low-Poly Terrain:** Completely removed the terrain engine and localized translations to streamline the application core.

### Optimized
*   **🌌 Deep Nebula v1.4.0:** 
    *   **Event Horizon Core:** Added a dark center that expands with Bass frequencies, creating a gravitational lensing/black hole visual effect.
    *   **Cosmic Background Radiation (CBR):** Introduced high-frequency pixel grain that reacts to Treble peaks, adding granular texture.
    *   **Kinetic Damping:** Reduced global particle speed and rotation scales by 50% to align with the cinematic/elegant optimization request.
