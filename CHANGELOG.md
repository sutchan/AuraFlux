# Changelog

All notable changes to the **Aura Flux** project will be documented in this file.

## [v1.6.83] - 2025-02-22

### Visuals
*   **🧠 Neural Flow (Hyper-Reactive):** Doubled the reactivity parameters to fix "unnoticeable interaction".
    *   **Bass Displacement:** Increased from 25.0 to **50.0** for explosive particle movement on drops.
    *   **Flow Speed:** Dynamic time multiplier increased to **4.0x** at max volume (was 2.5x).
    *   **Shockwave:** Beat impact force nearly doubled (12.0 -> **25.0**).

## [v1.6.82] - 2025-02-22

### Performance
*   **🧠 Neural Flow (Optimization):** Reduced particle count by 50% across all quality settings (High: 24k -> 12k) to significantly improve GPU performance on mobile devices and high-resolution displays, while compensating with slightly larger particle sizes and dynamic flow.

## [v1.6.81] - 2025-02-22

### Optimized
*   **🧠 Neural Flow (Dynamics):** Implemented audio-driven time integration. The particle flow now accelerates significantly based on volume intensity, creating a "dancing" effect. Bass displacement amplitude increased by 2x for deeper breathing motion.
